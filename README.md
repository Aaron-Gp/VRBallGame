## System requirement:

Binary files can only be executed on Windows.

If you want to build the source code, you need to have Visual Studio 2010/2012 and Unity3D 5 installed on your machine.


## Building the application

To build the application, you need to build two programs, one of which is the face tracker located in the OpenCV folder, the other
is the Unity Game program located in the Unity3D folder. You can just follow the instruction in OpenCV folder to build the first 
program. The second program can be built using Unity3D.

## Running the programs

To run the first program, you must provide -p option followed by the path to the paremeter file, which is /OpenCV/my_parameters.txt.
(of course it must be relative to the location of the executable program). Refer to the readme files in the OpenCV folder for
 information of other options. To run the second program, you just need to generate the binary file using Unity3D and run it 
 directly. 
 
 We'll provide compiled exeutable programs soon.
